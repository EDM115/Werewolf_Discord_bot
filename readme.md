## How it works ?

This will use the [`pycord framework`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord), because discord.py is no longer maintained  

---

## How to deploy it ?

Work in progress, but we're thinking about simple deploy to 
<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/EDM115/Werewolf_Discord_bot" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="Heroku" width="147" height="32" border="0"/></a> or
