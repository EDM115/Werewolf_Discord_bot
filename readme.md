## How it works ?

This will use the [`pycord framework`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord), because discord.py is no longer maintained  

---

## How to deploy it ?

Work in progress, but we're thinking about [![Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy), [![Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/EDM115/Werewolf_Discord_bot)](https://repl.it/github/EDM115/Werewolf_Discord_bot}&ref=button) or [![Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EDM115/Werewolf_Discord_bot)
